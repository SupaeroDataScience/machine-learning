This class takes a geometrical approach to Machine Learning through the prism of Support Vector Machines. It covers linear classifiers for data separation first. On the way, it introduces the bias/variance tradeoff. Then it presents a bit of kernel theory and applies it in linear classifiers to reach non-linear SVMs. It then provides perspectives on multi-class classification, support vector regression and density estimation with one-class SVM. Two full practical examples are provided at the end.
