While the model may be very complex globally, it is easier to approximate it around the vicinity of a particular instance. While treating the model as a black box, we perturb the instance we want to explain and learn a sparse linear model around it, as an explanation.*\n","\n","![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcotcr/lime/master/doc/images/lime.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"a1245910"},"source":["## Algorithm steps\n","The different steps computed by the algorithm are the following :\n","\n","### 1.

Creation of superpixels :\n","The alorithm first requires to generate \"superpixels\" which are composed of contigous pixels that share properties such as texture or color distribution.This step is crucial for the generation of the LIME explanation since perturbation of superpixels is used to identify which of the image areas has been relevant for a specific class decision.\n","\n","LIME uses the quickshift algorithm to produce these superpixels (more details here : https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/assets/pubs/vedaldi08quick.pdf)\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=https://www.oreilly.com/content/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/06/figure3-2cea505fe733a4713eeff3b90f696507.jpg width=500>\n","</p>\n","\n","\n","\n","### 2. Generate perturbed instances :\n","Once the superpixels are defined, we can generate a new dataset of perturbed instances by turning off superpixels on the image. The interpretable representation of the image is a binary vector where 1 indicates the original super-pixel and 0 indicates a grayed out super-pixel.\n","\n","### 3. Fit a linear model on the samples\n","\n","We can now fit a linear model on the perturbed instance to a specific class and highlight the superpixels with positive or negative weight towards a specific class.\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=https://www.oreilly.com/content/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/06/figure4-99d9ea184dd35876e0dbae81f6fce038.jpg width=500>\n","</p>\n","\n","\n","#

of fairly distributing both gains and costs to several actors working in coalition.\n","* The Shapley value applies primarily in situations when the contributions of each actor are unequal, but they work in cooperation with each other to obtain the payoff.\n","\n","You first start by identifying each player’s contribution when they play individually, when 2 play together, and when all 3 play together.\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=https://clearcode.cc/app/uploads/2016/11/ABC-wide.png width=500>\n","</p>\n","\n","Then, you need to consider all possible orders and calculate their marginal value – e.g. what value does each player add when player A enters the game first, followed by player B, and then player C.\n","Below are the 6 possible orders and the marginal value each player adds in the different combinations:\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=https://clearcode.cc/app/uploads/2016/11/ABC-updated.png width=500>\n","</p>\n","\n","Now that we have calculated each player’s marginal value across all 6 possible order combinations, we now need to add them up and work out the Shapley value (i.e. the average) for each player.\n","\n","<ins>Example for Player A:</ins>\n","$ \\text{Shapley}_{value} = \\frac{7+7+10+3+9+10}{6} \\approx 7.7$\n","\n","Computing the Shapley value for each player will give the true contribution each player made to the game and assign credit fairly\n","\n","## To Explainability Method\n","\n","* Each value of an independent variable or a feature for a given sample is a part of a cooperative game where we assume that prediction is actually the payout.\n","* Shapley values correspond to the contribution of each feature towards pushing the prediction away from the expected value.\n","\n","Let take an example of the median house value prediction for California districts\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shap/shap/master/docs/artwork/california_waterfall.png

The prediction is fairly distributed among the feature values. We get contrastive explanations that compare the prediction with the average prediction.\n","* SHAP has a fast implementation for tree-based models.\n","* When computation of the many Shapley values is possible, global model interpretations can be built.
